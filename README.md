# WP Investigator
WP Investigator is a WordPress plugin for determining where javascript files are coming from! Essentially, it will tell you which plugins or themes are including which script files -- allowing you to figure out why your site is loading so many!

WP Investigator is a completely new work in progress, and is not yet sufficiently progressed for general use (as of writing there is no UI). When it is ready for use expect to find it in the WordPress plugins directory.
